# <font size="3"> An Analysis By: James Gamarra <ul><em> Data Set: U.S. Gun Violence Records 2014-2021: Archive of Gun Violence incidents in United States</em></ul></font> 
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <ul><p>Gun violence in the United States is a well documented problem that has no clear resolution. My aim through the course of this analysis is to examine an aggregated data set in an attempt to examine correlations, outliers, and any key contributing factors that may cause an influx or deflux in gun related incidents.
