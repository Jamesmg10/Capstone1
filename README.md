<h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <ul><p>Gun violence in the United States is a well documented problem that has no clear resolution. My aim through the course of this analysis is to examine an aggregated data set in an attempt to examine correlations, outliers, and any key contributing factors that may cause an influx or deflux in gun related incidents.

    <li>
     Gun violence  and crime incidents are collected/validated from 7,500 sources daily – Incident Reports and their source data are found at the gunviolencearchive.org website. However, this does not ensure a complete data set.

<h3>Data Set Constraints:</h3>
<li>Aggregated Data
    <ul>
        <li>Data is condensed to 3,230 from over 300,000 entries for purposes of analysis.</li>
    </ul>

<li>
    States are not required to report all incidents.

<h2> Part 1:<em> Federal Analysis</em>
</h2>
<p>
In terms of the scope of the data, 3230 entries representing 8 years of gun related incidents, it is best to begin analysis on a broader scope and narrow through calculated research.
</p>
<p>
In the past decade federal policy has been forced to address the impeding crisis that is gun violence in the United States. This talking point, widely debated, has seemingly no remedy in sight. Our data set contains data from the Obama Administration as well as the Trump administration. Two presdencies with vastly diffrent views on gun-policy and gun control in the United States.

At face value, you can deduce two things:
<ul>1.There is a clear and obvious increase every year
